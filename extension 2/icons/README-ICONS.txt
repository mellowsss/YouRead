ICON GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

To create the extension icons:

1. Open "generate-logo-icons.html" in your web browser
2. Click "Generate Icons" button
3. Right-click each canvas and "Save image as..."
4. Save as:
   - icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
   - icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
   - icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
5. Make sure all 3 files are in this icons/ folder

The logo design:
- Rounded square with teal (left) and coral/red (right) halves
- White "M" letter in the center
- White border around the square
- Thin dashed line down the center

Once you have all 3 PNG files, the extension will work properly!
